                        As a team, we volunteered at LeapCoderz, a S.T.E.A.M. based learning center. We initially taught just robotics and coding classes which consisted of Lego 
                        Mindstorms, java, python, however we then loved the environment so much we took upon additional classes such as chess and public speaking. As we were 
                        teaching we realized we were teaching the next generation of students, the next generation of robotics. We loved volunteering at LeapCoderz, we were able to 
                        meet so many new mentors, students, and parents all of whom we built strong relationships with. Overall, LeapCoderz was a great experience!</p>
